		Java Client

This Java Client interfaces - using a bluetooth connection - to the
"example 7" server.

Bluetooth is a new area for me, so there are - most likely - lost
of improvements possible.

The communication protocol is described in the file protocol.h
in the example-7 directory. While it is reasonable stable, changes
are always possible.


Compiling the java client is
	javac -classpath .:./bluecove-2.1.0.jar JavaRadio.java 

Running the client is
	java -cp .:./bluecove-2.1.0.jar:./bluecove-gpl-2.1.0,jar JavaRadio
